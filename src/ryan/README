= Building web applications with Ryan

== Routing

Following REST idioma, Ryan provides the ability to parse any url and run the
corresponding controller.
http://host:post/store/fruits/show/122
will be passed to 'store' application, 'fruits' controller, 'show' action (method),
providing it with cookie data, http request method (~GET, ~PUT, ~POST, ~DELETE, ~UPDATE etc.),
and parsed query data list.

== Controllers
Controllers are Reia modules. They reside in application_name/controllers/ folder.
By default each controller method is available to web application user unless overwise defined
in routing schema.

== Views

Views can be Retem templates (retems) and are placed in application_name/views/ folder.

== Models

Models are object definitions that can be stored, retrieved and queried from storage
systems.
SQLite3, PostgreSQL, Mnesia and Mongo are to be supported.
